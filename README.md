# PythonCoffeeMachine
This project was completed through Hyperskill's Python Core Course. It uses python and object-oriented programming techniques to create an interactive coffee machine through which you can buy coffee, fill the machine up with ingredients/materials, and withdraw money.

Hyperskill's Description of the Project:
"What can be better than a cup of coffee during a break? A coffee that you don’t have to make yourself. It’s enough to press a couple of buttons on the machine and you get a cup of energy; but first, we should teach the machine how to do it. In this project, you will work on programming a coffee machine simulator. The machine works with typical products: coffee, milk, sugar, and plastic cups; if it runs out of something, it shows a notification. You can get three types of coffee: espresso, cappuccino, and latte. Since nothing’s for free, it also collects the money."

Enjoy the Project!
